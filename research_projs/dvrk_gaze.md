Eye gaze tracking can enable numerous exciting applications in robotic surgery such as hands-free instrument control, skill assessment, and cooperative surgical procedures. However, existing methods in gaze estimation either rely on complex hardware installations on the surgeon console or are sensitive to head movements post calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of wearable eye tracking glasses on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). With a stereo calibration procedure and head tracking technology, we quantify gaze estimation error and decalibration events, such as head movement and glasses slippage. We show that these are significant sources of error in wearable gaze tracking technology. Future work includes compensating for these decalibration events for robust eye tracking in robotic surgery.
