The current apprenticeship model for surgical training in the operating room is insufficient to meet the growing demand for more surgeons. Many endoscopic procedures are taught in the operating room, limiting trainees’ opportunities for experimentation and feedback. Current training simulations for minimally invasive surgeries require costly equipment and expert surgeons for feedback. Alternatively, Augmented reality has the potential to increase flexibility and effectiveness in endoscopic surgical training, but additional research is critical to understanding the needs of surgical trainees so that such systems are designed to meet their needs. Thus, we work together with surgical trainees and experts by conducting semi-structured interviews with co-design activity to integrate their designs into the AR applications.
