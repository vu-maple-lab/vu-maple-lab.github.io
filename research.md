(include a couple paragraphs on the overall research aims of our lab, see https://www.allanlab.org/research/ for reference). 

### Radiation Visualization using Augmented Reality

For neoadjuvant radiation therapy treatment for Sarcoma, radiation oncologists prepare radiation dose distribution maps based off of CT scans. After administration of radiation therapy, often a tumor resection is performed for sarcoma patients who are in a later stage of cancer. To mitigate tissue necrosis following tumor resection surgery, surgical oncologists would benefit from viewing the radiation dose distribution on the anatomy of the patient. Through prescribing feature points and the camera input from an augmented reality headset, the virtual model of the patientâ€™s radiation dose distribution can be overlayed onto their physical anatomy in the operating room via means of an augmented reality application. During the augmented reality application runtime, the alignment of the virtual hologram to the physical anatomy is automatic, in real-time, and stable across multiple viewing angles. In addition, users can manipulate aspects of the virtual model with thresholds of radiation, transparency, and toggleable regions.

### Robust Eye Tracking for da Vinci Surgical System

Eye gaze tracking can enable numerous exciting applications in robotic surgery such as hands-free instrument control, skill assessment, and cooperative surgical procedures. However, existing methods in gaze estimation either rely on complex hardware installations on the surgeon console or are sensitive to head movements post calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of wearable eye tracking glasses on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). With a stereo calibration procedure and head tracking technology, we quantify gaze estimation error and decalibration events, such as head movement and glasses slippage. We show that these are significant sources of error in wearable gaze tracking technology. Future work includes compensating for these decalibration events for robust eye tracking in robotic surgery.
